# Pixlings

A tiny pixel creature that lives above your Claude Code prompt and keeps an eye on the things Claude Code doesn't show you.

> **Coming from `/buddy`?** `/pixling adopt` finds the companion Claude Code left in your config and brings it back: its name, its personality, and the days you've spent together. `/buddy`, `/buddy pet`, `/buddy off` and `/buddy on` work too.

- **Your prompt cache, counted down.** Each message re-reads the conversation from Anthropic's prompt cache at a tenth of the normal input price. After five minutes of silence (an hour, if your setup uses the longer cache) the cache is gone, and the next message writes the whole context again at 1.25× (2× for the hour-long cache). On a 150k-token conversation that one message costs about twelve times more. Pixlings shows the countdown, and a minute before it runs out your pixling taps the glass. Switch models with a warm, expensive cache and it asks first.
- **It wakes Claude when your limit resets.** Hit your usage limit and it naps with a countdown. When the window resets it wakes up and tells Claude to carry on, so a long task finishes while you sleep.
- **It brings a squad.** Every subagent Claude starts gets a little helper beside your pixling, carrying that agent's tools. When an agent finishes, its helper jumps for joy and goes.
- **Sound and notifications on every OS.** It calls you when Claude needs permission or finishes a long turn, with a chiptune ping and a desktop notification. The Mods sound API only plays on macOS, so Pixlings brings its own players for Windows and Linux.
- **It yelps before risky commands run.** `rm -rf`, `git push --force`, `git reset --hard`, `DROP TABLE`, `curl … | sh` and friends, read the way a shell reads them: `grep "DROP TABLE"` or a commit message that mentions `rm -rf` won't set it off.
- **It hears everything.** Every "You're absolutely right" gets an eye roll and goes on the tally.

## Install

Needs Claude Code 2.1.287 or newer, the first version with mods.

```sh
claude plugin marketplace add cglremrcn/pixlings
claude plugin install pixlings@pixlings
```

Start a new Claude Code session and an egg hatches. Every setting has a default, so there is nothing to configure.

## Meet yours

<p align="center"><img src="docs/media/roster.gif" width="100%" alt="The fifteen species: blip, duck, cat, snail, rabbit, robot, cactus, capybara, penguin, owl, axolotl, turtle, ghost, goose and dragon"></p>

Fifteen species in five rarities, from the five commons (half of all eggs) to a legendary dragon (1.5%). One egg in 64 hatches shiny. Each one hatches with a personality of its own, and an adopted Buddy keeps the one it had.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/media/hatch.gif" width="32%" alt="An egg wobbles, cracks and flashes gold, and a legendary dragon hatches">
  <img src="docs/media/shiny.gif" width="66%" alt="The shiny palette of every species">
</p>

It reacts to the session: tests, commits, pushes, pull requests, risky commands, permission prompts, API errors, rate limits. It gets squished under a press while the conversation is compacted and springs back with a sigh of relief, sweats once the context passes 85%, and puts on its thinking cap in plan mode. It dozes after fifteen minutes on its own and is glad when you come back.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/media/moods.gif" width="100%" alt="Twelve moods: idle, working, tests pass, bug squashed, tests fail, alarmed, needs you, rate limit nap, petted, API error, unimpressed, strolling"></p>

Turning a failing test suite green counts as squashing a bug. While Claude works, the spinner talks like your pixling (*Quacking…*, *Haunting…*, *Compiling feelings…*), and when Claude is idle it wanders along the free space of the band. Hover over the band for its card: personality, streak, badges and what it has heard.

It levels up as you work, and unlocks things to wear:

<p align="center"><img src="docs/media/gear.gif" width="100%" alt="Hats unlocked by level: a sprout at 2, a mushroom cap at 4, sunglasses at 6, a party hat at 9, a crown at 12, a halo at 18, a wizard hat at 25"></p>

## Where it lives

In the terminal and the desktop app it lives in the band above the prompt. `/pixling room` opens its room in a pane, and the room works everywhere, VS Code and the mobile app included, where there is no band: your pixling, its stats, a garden of the species you've found and a shelf of badges.

## The vitals row

Under its name sits one line:

```
⏳ cache 4:12 · 92% cached · ctx 41% · 5h 23% · turn +2% · opus 5.5 · high
```

| Piece | What it tells you |
|---|---|
| `⏳ cache 4:12` | Time until the prompt cache expires. `⚡ cache live` while Claude is working, `❄ cache cold` once it has expired. It turns yellow, then red in the last minute. |
| `92% cached` | How much of this session's input was served from the cache. |
| `ctx 41%` | How full the context window is. |
| `5h 23%` | Your rate-limit windows (five-hour and weekly). |
| `turn +2%` | How much of a window the last turn used. |
| `opus 5.5 · high` | The model and the effort it is thinking at. |

Claude Code doesn't tell a mod how long the cache lives, so Pixlings works it out from each request's token counts. It starts by assuming five minutes, shown with a `~`. Two cache hits after long pauses prove you have the hour; a full miss inside the hour proves you don't. A `/model` switch names the lifetime outright. When you come back to a cold cache it tells you how many tokens were written again, and counts it.

## Trading cards

`/pixling share` draws a card, saves it to your home folder as `pixling-<name>.png`, opens it, and puts a post on your clipboard.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/media/card.png" width="80%" alt="A trading card: Ember, a shiny legendary dragon in a wizard hat, level 43, 5,120 turns, 640 commits, 120 bugs squashed, a 41-day streak, all 16 badges, and &quot;You're absolutely right&quot; heard 312 times"></p>

## Badges, streaks and the morning recap

Sixteen badges, each earned once: **Exterminator** for squashing 10 bugs, **Night Owl** for 25 turns after midnight, **Brain Freeze** for letting the cache go cold 10 times, **Absolutely Right** for hearing it 25 times, **On Fire** for a 7-day streak, **Liftoff** for your first pull request, and ten more. `/pixling badges` lists them all with how far along you are.

It counts the days in a row you show up, and the first session of the day opens with yesterday: *Yesterday: 41 turns · 6 commits · 2 bugs squashed · +212 XP*.

## Commands

| Command | |
|---|---|
| `/pixling` | Its card: stats, personality, badges, what it has heard, the cache |
| `/pixling adopt [species]` | Bring back your old `/buddy`: its name, personality and days together. Give a species to change its body too. |
| `/pixling room` | Open its room: stats, the dex garden, the badge shelf |
| `/pixling share` | Save a trading card and copy a post to go with it |
| `/pixling badges` | Every badge, earned or not, with progress |
| `/pixling pet` | ♥ |
| `/pixling name <name>` | Rename it |
| `/pixling wear [item]` | Show the wardrobe, or put something on (`none` to take it all off) |
| `/pixling dex` | The species you have hatched so far |
| `/pixling off`, `/pixling on` | Send it away (no band, sound, voice, notifications or auto-continue; stats still count), and bring it back. It remembers. |
| `/pixling hatch` | Release it and hatch a new egg. Level and stats start over; badges, streak and dex stay. |
| `/buddy`, `/buddy pet`, `/buddy off`, `/buddy on` | The same, under the old name |

| `heckle` | A faint eye roll and running count under Claude's "You're absolutely right" | off |

## Questions

**Does it eat my context or my tokens?** No. Nothing it draws, plays or tracks goes into Claude's prompt, and out of the box it never calls a model: `claude plugin details pixlings@pixlings` reports about 0 always-on tokens. What a `/pixling` command prints lands in the transcript like any command output (a few tokens, about 450 for `/pixling badges`), and auto-continue sends one short prompt after a limit reset. Turn `quips` to `haiku` and it asks Claude Haiku for a line now and then: at most once a minute, about a hundred tokens each, and every quip shows what it cost.

**What does `/pixling adopt` read?** Claude Code kept your Buddy in its config file, `~/.claude.json` (or the one in `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`). Pixlings reads that file on your machine and keeps three things from it: the companion's name, its personality and when it hatched. Nothing else is kept. Pixlings sends nothing anywhere itself, but the reply to `/pixling adopt` names your Buddy and its personality, and like any command's output it is part of the conversation Claude reads. With `quips` on, the personality is also part of each quip's request (below).

**Does it send anything anywhere?** No network requests of its own. Its save lives in Claude Code's plugin store on your machine. With `quips` on, the quip request goes through Claude Code to Claude Haiku and holds only your pixling's name, species and personality and what happened in numbers ("3 tests just failed"): never your code, your prompts or your files.

**Will the cache guard get in my way?** It asks only when you switch models yourself (with `/model`, the `/config` row or the model picker; a switch made through the SDK, Remote Control or an IDE goes through), the cache is still warm, and writing it again on the new model would cost more than about $0.25. Answer and the switch goes on.

**Is it heavy?** Drawing a frame takes about 0.04 ms, ten times a second. Each sound plays in a short-lived process; on Windows that is a PowerShell that lives for about a second.

**I want the useful parts, not the creature.** Set `band` to `minimal` for a single line with the cache countdown, or `off` to hide it. Sounds, notifications, the risky-command alarm, the cache guard and auto-continue keep working.

**It's too much.** `chatter: quiet`, `sound: important`, `voice: off`, `roam: off`. Or `/pixling off` until you want it back.

**Where does the card go?** Your home folder: `%USERPROFILE%` on Windows, `~` elsewhere.

## How it's made

It's a Claude Code mod written in TypeScript. The sprites are 16×16 palette grids composed into a small canvas and sent to the terminal as half-block characters, two pixels per cell, about ten frames a second. Outside the terminal (the desktop app, and the room in VS Code or on your phone) it draws an SVG instead. The event sounds are generated from scratch by [`tools/synth.py`](tools/synth.py). The voice is synthesized for each line, from harmonics shaped by vowel formants. The share card is a PNG encoded inside the mod, with its own 5×7 pixel font and its own deflate.

The creature in every image here is drawn by the plugin's own code, frame by frame; the terminal around it in the top GIF is painted by [`tools/make_hero.py`](tools/make_hero.py). The scripts are in [`tools/`](tools). To run the tests:

```sh
claude plugin test plugins/pixlings
```
